# Changelog

### 1.2.1

- Fix memory leak in `withFilter`. [PR #209](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions/pull/209)

### 1.2.0

- Add `graphql@15` to `peerDependencies`.

### 1.1.0

- Fix [#132](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions/issues/132) - withFilter was previously always passing undefined as its first argument to the filterFn
- Partially attempt to fix [#143](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions/issues/143) - try to reduce occurrence of certain memory leaks with the built-in PubSubEngine implementation
- Replaced `eventEmitterAsyncIterator` with default generic `AsyncIterator` named `PubSubAsyncIterator`. `extends PubSubEngine` automatically uses generic implementation. No breaking changes for those who continue to use `implements PubSubEngine`. See PR [#78](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions/pull/78).
