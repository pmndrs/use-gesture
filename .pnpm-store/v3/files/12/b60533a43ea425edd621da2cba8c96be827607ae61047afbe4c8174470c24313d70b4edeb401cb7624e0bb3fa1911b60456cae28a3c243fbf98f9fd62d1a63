 * looksLikeADate isn't a 100% valid check if it is a real date but at least it's something that looks like a date.
 * It won't catch values like 2010-02-30
 * 1) is it a number?
 * 2) does the length of the value comply with any of our formats
 * 3) does the str starts with 4 digites (YYYY)
 * 4) does the str ends with something that looks like a date
 * 5) Small regex to see if it matches any of the formats
 * 6) check momentjs
