**GraphQL Config** - one configuration for all your GraphQL tools (supported by most tools, editors & IDEs).
The easiest way to configure your development environment with your GraphQL Schema.

**As a developer**, you gain simplicity and a central place to setup libraries, tools and your IDE extensions.

**As a library author** GraphQL Config makes it easier to maintain the code responsible for handling configuration, loading GraphQL schemas or even files with GraphQL operations and fragments. GraphQL Config provides a set of useful methods and an easy-to-work-with API.

## Example

```yaml
schema: ./schema.json
documents: ./src/components/**/*.jsx
```
