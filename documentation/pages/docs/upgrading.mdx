# Upgrading to @use-gesture/react

How to switch from `react-use-gesture` to <UseGesture pkg="react" />

## Transition

`react-use-gesture` was born as a React-only project. <UseGesture pkg="react" /> replaces `react-use-gesture` completely and relies on a universal core, <UseGesture pkg="core" /> that also powers <UseGesture pkg="vanilla" />.

Upgrading from `react-use-gesture` to <UseGesture pkg="react" /> is rather straightforward, although includes some breaking changes that are listed [here](https://github.com/pmndrs/use-gesture/blob/main/packages/react/CHANGELOG.md#1000).

### Main breaking change

The API is 95% the same as before, the main one being the `domTarget` option being renamed to `target`.
